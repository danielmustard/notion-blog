# Notion Blog
Code for my blog page that is currently using Next.js 13, [React Notion](https://github.com/splitbee/react-notion) and [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) for styles.

For storing post data I'm using [notion](https://www.notion.so) as a headless CMS.
Originally used Vite ([Code Here](https://github.com/danielmustard/notion-blog/tree/old-vite-code)) for this project however I was doing all rendering client side so it was slow + no option for site indexing/bad for SEO.
